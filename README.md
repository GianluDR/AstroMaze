**Astro Maze Project - Unity Game for Procedural Maze Solving**

**Code:** assets/scripts/

Astro Maze was a Unity-based project developed for my thesis study on procedural generation. The game involves maneuvering a cube through procedurally generated mazes of increasing complexity.

**Technologies Used:**

**Unity (C#):** Utilized for game development, enabling creation and management of game assets, as well as implementing game mechanics and interactions.

**Procedural Generation Algorithms:** Developed algorithms for generating mazes procedurally, ensuring unique and challenging experiences for players.

**C# Scripting:** Implemented C# scripts for various game features, including movement, collision detection, and procedural maze generation.

**User Interface Design:** Designed and implemented the user interface for a seamless gaming experience.

Through this project, I gained extensive experience in Unity game development and procedural maze generation. It required a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures to ensure the creation of engaging and dynamic gameplay. The endeavor honed my problem-solving skills and provided insight into optimizing game performance while delivering an enjoyable gaming experience to the players.
